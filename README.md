## Integrated model based on LABS

LABS provides multiple layers of information for sensitive detection of cancer from low-input cfDNA.
1. DNA methylation (TSS methylation)
2. Copy number alteration
3. Cell-type-specific or tissue-type-specific contributions of cfDNA

Integrated model based on all layers of information gives better performance than methylation information alone.
